# LandMarkAIDetector

This is fun project which uses TFlite(pretrained model) and cameraX api from jetpack compose to scan images of landmarks(only works for landmark in Asia) to identify names of landmark.


## BuildWith

This application is crafted using the latest advancements in mobile development. At its core, it leverages the power of Jetpack Compose, providing a modern and intuitive user interface that seamlessly integrates with CameraX API for capturing and processing images with unparalleled ease. To enhance its capabilities, the app harnesses the prowess of TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), enabling efficient on-device machine learning, ensuring swift and intelligent data processing. Together, these cutting-edge technologies create an innovative and fluid experience.
